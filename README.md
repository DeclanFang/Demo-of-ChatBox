# Demo-of-ChatBox
The first version of ChatBox without frontend... What a pity! 

This is a chatroom based on the TCP connection with an original Server frame, which can implement the notification of people entering the room and private chatting between two users. 

Still working on the frontend to make the ChatBox pretty! 

See the demo GIF below to learn how it works! 

This is how the system notificates others when someone new enters the ChatBox:

This is how the private conversation works in the ChatBox for now, by adding the "@Name:" part we can make the group chat becomes a private conversation under the ChatBox, the message can only be noticed by two people. 

We can see that Vincent has no idea what's going on in the ChatBox, but Declan and Minnie have something to share. Enjoy the drama!
